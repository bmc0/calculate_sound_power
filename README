This is a small python script to calculate loudspeaker sound power and
directivity index.

Usage:
	calculate_sound_power.py [OPTION...]

Options:
	--interval=n         measurement interval in degrees (default: 15)
	--di-offset=n        DI curve offset in dB (default: 50)
	--mirror-horizontal  use only positive angles for horizontal orbit
	--mirror-vertical    use only positive angles for vertical orbit
	-h, --help           show this help

All input files must have the same number of data points and use the same
frequencies. No interpolation is done. The expected format is:

	[* Comment]
	<freq_Hz> <magnitude_dB>

Everything after <magnitude_dB> (usually just phase) is ignored. Files
from Room EQ Wizard work (use "Export measurement as text").

Frequency responses must be named {h,v}<angle>.txt. 0° and 180° responses are
only read from the set of horizontal responses since the vertical ones would be
the same.

The listening axis response must be named listening_axis.txt. This could just
be a duplicate of one of the other files, or could be the listening window
instead. If the listening axis response is not provided, the DI will not be
calculated.

You can specify a correction to apply to all files with correction.txt.

The output files are as follows:
	corrected_listening_axis.txt   -- same as listening_axis.txt if
	                                  correction.txt does not exist.
	sound_power.txt                -- total radiated sound power
	directivity_index.txt          -- directivity index

Here's a Gnuplot script to produce a nice graph from the output files:

set logscale x
set xtics autofreq
set ytics 10
set mxtics default
set mytics 5
set grid xtics ytics mxtics mytics
set xlabel "Frequency (Hz)"
set ylabel "Sound Pressure Level (dB ref 20µPa)"
set datafile commentschars '*'
set term pngcairo size 1024,768 font 'Dejavu Sans, 10'
set output 'sound_power.png'

plot [20:20000] [50:100] \
	'corrected_listening_axis.txt' using 1:2 title 'Listening Axis'    with lines, \
	'sound_power.txt'              using 1:2 title 'Total Sound Power' with lines, \
	'directivity_index.txt'        using 1:($2+50) title 'Directivity Index' with lines
